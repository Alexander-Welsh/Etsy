Kinek has set up secure parcel receiving locations, called Kinek Points, at nearly every major border crossing between the US and Canada. Each location is located on the US side of the border and by signing up for the Kinek service and shipping to one of them, you can receive the same shipping prices as US customers. Once your package arrives, Kinek notifies you (by email, text message, or push notification) and will then store the package for up to 30 days for you. You can then drive to the Kinek Point and pick up the item at a convenient time for you. Upon pick-up, you pay a small fee, usually $5 for packages under 30lbs, far less than international shipping and brokerage fees! Some of the major cities Kinek serves are: Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Ottawa, Winnipeg, London, Kingston, Kelowna, Sault Ste. Marie, Saint John, Fredericton, Calgary and Cornwall.\n\nwww.kinek.com","creation_tsz":1467327290,"ending_tsz":1477868090,"original_creation_tsz":1391622309,"last_modified_tsz":1467327290,"price":"495.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":94,"tags":[],"category_path":["Housewares","Home Decor"],"category_path_ids":[69150425,68892008],"materials":[],"shop_section_id":12595285,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1430934905,"url":"https://www.etsy.com/listing/178356332/old-whiskey-barrel-trash-can-with-double?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":591,"num_favorers":12,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":5,"processing_max":10,"who_made":"collective","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2016","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":1002,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Home Décor"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":560579399,"hex_code":"7A5849","red":122,"green":88,"blue":73,"hue":18,"saturation":40,"brightness":47,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1391622309,"listing_id":178356332,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https://img1.etsystatic.com/028/0/6283354/il_75x75.560579399_2dbm.jpg","url_170x135":"https://img1.etsystatic.com/028/0/6283354/il_170x135.560579399_2dbm.jpg","url_570xN":"https://img1.etsystatic.com/028/0/6283354/il_570xN.560579399_2dbm.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https://img1.etsystatic.com/028/0/6283354/il_fullxfull.560579399_2dbm.jpg","full_height":512,"full_width":305},{"listing_image_id":560467636,"hex_code":"636066","red":99,"green":96,"blue":102,"hue":270,"saturation":5,"brightness":40,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1391622309,"listing_id":178356332,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https://img0.etsystatic.com/035/0/6283354/il_75x75.560467636_qaj9.jpg","url_170x135":"https://img0.etsystatic.com/035/0/6283354/il_170x135.560467636_qaj9.jpg","url_570xN":"https://img0.etsystatic.com/035/0/6283354/il_570xN.560467636_qaj9.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https://img0.etsystatic.com/035/0/6283354/il_fullxfull.560467636_qaj9.jpg","full_height":513,"full_width":329},{"listing_image_id":1021143969,"hex_code":"846E65","red":132,"green":110,"blue":101,"hue":17,"saturation":23,"brightness":51,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1463165027,"listing_id":178356332,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https://img1.etsystatic.com/125/0/6283354/il_75x75.1021143969_k9aj.jpg","url_170x135":"https://img1.etsystatic.com/125/0/6283354/il_170x135.1021143969_k9aj.jpg","url_570xN":"https://img1.etsystatic.com/125/0/6283354/il_570xN.1021143969_k9aj.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https://img1.etsystatic.com/125/0/6283354/il_fullxfull.1021143969_k9aj.jpg","full_height":389,"full_width":543},{"listing_image_id":974612212,"hex_code":"836F63","red":131,"green":111,"blue":99,"hue":22,"saturation":24,"brightness":51,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1463165027,"listing_id":178356332,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https://img0.etsystatic.com/127/0/6283354/il_75x75.974612212_6kxn.jpg","url_170x135":"https://img0.etsystatic.com/127/0/6283354/il_170x135.974612212_6kxn.jpg","url_570xN":"https://img0.etsystatic.com/127/0/6283354/il_570xN.974612212_6kxn.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https://img0.etsystatic.com/127/0/6283354/il_fullxfull.974612212_6kxn.jpg","full_height":405,"full_width":537},{"listing_image_id":974612320,"hex_code":"826C62","red":130,"green":108,"blue":98,"hue":19,"saturation":24,"brightness":50,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1463165027,"listing_id":178356332,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https://img0.etsystatic.com/101/0/6283354/il_75x75.974612320_gk5s.jpg","url_170x135":"https://img0.etsystatic.com/101/0/6283354/il_170x135.974612320_gk5s.jpg","url_570xN":"https://img0.etsystatic.com/101/0/6283354/il_570xN.974612320_gk5s.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https://img0.etsystatic.com/101/0/6283354/il_fullxfull.974612320_gk5s.jpg","full_height":527,"full_width":336}],"Shop":{"shop_id":6283354,"shop_name":"AuntMollysBarrels","user_id":14322428,"creation_tsz":1301844688,"title":null,"announcement":null,"currency_code":"USD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":null,"sale_message":null,"digital_sale_message":null,"last_updated_tsz":1467327290,"listing_active_count":62,"digital_listing_count":0,"login_name":"AuntMollysBarrels","accepts_custom_requests":false,"policy_welcome":null,"policy_payment":"SECURE OPTIONS\nEtsy keeps your payment information secure.

Free Shipping!","description":"This listing is for our Charred White Oak Sticks!  \n\nThanks for ordering your Kiln Dried and then Charred White Oak Sticks from The Murray Merchant!\n\nOur White Oak sticks have been charred in a very hot oven during the manufacturing process.   \n\nThere are two methods to use these food grade hand chipped and charred white oak wood sticks.  \n\nIf you are using our White Oak Sticks in a process with less than 20% alcohol we recommend that you re-toast at 350 degrees for one additional hour.   (It makes your whole house smell like the aroma of our White Oak!) \n\nYou could also boil them for ten minutes. \n\nThe reason is to make sure you kill all the yeasty-beasties that may have found a home in our sticks during packaging and shipping.  You don’t want to add these critters to your tasty drink!\n\nIf you are aging your spirits that have an alcohol content above 20% with our Kiln Dried and then charred White Oak Sticks, just throw them in!  You will be pleasantly surprised as to how fast your spirits will “age.”   \n\nYou should use about two ounces per quart.  You get FAST results that way.\n\nYou can re-use our White Oak Sticks three or four times!  And when you are done they can add flavor to your grilled meats!  Enjoy, and come back for more!\n\n We have hand chosen Kiln Dried “Food Grade” Rough Cut White Oak Wood and “hand chopped” it to a good size that fits well into pint and quart jars.\n\nThere is no dust or dirt in our product.  We sell food grade charred White Oak.  Our White Oak is first kiln dried virgin lumber that is then chopped by hand, using tools of course, and roasted in a 350 degree oven to a dark caramel color.\n\n\nMore information you may enjoy!\n\nAll About Oak Barrel Aged Whiskey\n\nWhite Whiskey\n\nThere are a lot of different names for moonshine. White dog, white lightning, and mountain dew are among the more popular terms used to describe homemade spirits. What do these names have in common? Well, they hint at the fact that moonshine is typically crystal clear and typically doesn&#39;t have the dark caramel color that store bought whiskey does.\n\nAged Whiskey\n\nThe color (or lack thereof) of moonshine is confusing to a lot of people. You see, most folks think that moonshine is clear because it&#39;s made with a different process than store bought whiskey. However, that&#39;s not the case. Store bought whiskey (everything from Jim Beam Bourbon to Jameson Irish Whiskey) comes off the still as clear as mountain spring water. That&#39;s right, initially, all whiskeys look exactly like moonshine. It isn&#39;t until whiskey is aged in wooden barrels that it takes on darker colors. \n\nWhy is Whiskey Aged?\n\nWhy is whiskey aged? Well, similarly to many other longstanding traditions, the practice of barrel aging grew out of necessity. Early producers and transporters of wine used wooden barrels to ferment and then ship their products. Though, the practice has withstood the test of time because, coincidentally, long term storage in barrels has a positive effect on the character and smoothness of most alcoholic beverages. Early consumers of these beverages noticed that (typically) the longer the beverages had been stored in barrels, the better they tasted. Thus, the demand for barrel aged wine and spirits was born.\n\nWhat Happens During Aging?\n\nDuring the storage period changes in temperature and humidity cause alcohol to be pushed into and sometime sucked out of out of the wooden walls of aging barrels. As this natural ebb and flow occurs the alcohol is gently filtered by the wood. Some of the whiskey (typically lighter and more volatile compounds) actually evaporate through the wooden container walls (which is called the angels share). At the same time, vanillins and tannin are extracted from the wood and impart their unique flavor and color to the whiskey. The cumulative effect of the intricate process of barrel aging is a final product that has more character and less bite than the clear, fiery spirit that went into it.\n\nHow to Age Whiskey\n\nThere are two ways to age whiskey. The easiest way to accomplish aging is to add charred oak chips to a jar or bottle of spirits. The chips will naturally absorb and release spirits contained within the vessel, allowing the wood to impart its flavors to the spirit. However, this method will not allow the volatile compounds to escape by forcing their way through the container walls (as happens during traditional barrel aging). Accordingly, one must regularly open and close the vessel in order to allow trapped alcohol vapor to escape and be replaced by air. Amazon.com actually carries inexpensive, high quality, American oak aging chips.  \n\nA less involved but slightly more expensive method of DIY whiskey aging is to purchase an actual charred barrel. This method should be a bit easier to manage because evaporation of spirits and the resulting oxygenation will happen automatically. There will be no need to open an close the container to allow more volatile substances to escape. Once you have your barrel make sure to first fill it with warm water and leave it sit until the wood swells enough to prevent leaking between the staves. The hydration process could take anywhere from a few hours to a few days. It&#39;s very important that you do this to prevent your spirits from leaking out of the barrel when you initially fill it. Again, Amazon carries inexpensive, high quality wooden aging barrels.\n\nHow Long Does Barrel Aging Take?\n\nFantastic results can be achieved in a relatively short amount of time with home aging. This is because the surface to liquid ratio of DIY aging kits is much higher than that of commercial outfits. The commercial whiskey industry ages their product in 53 gallon barrels to achieve a better economy of scale. In a small half gallon barrel there is 4-5 times more wooden surface area in contact with the whiskey. It&#39;s less efficient from a materials standpoint (which is why commercial distilleries age in 50+ gallon barrels) but much more efficient from a time and aging standpoint. All of that extra surface area rapidly accelerates aging of the spirits. Aged perfection that takes years to achieve in 53 gallon barrels can be accomplished in a matter of months with a half gallon barrel.\n\nThe benefits of aging can be negated if too much of the wood flavor is imparted to the whiskey. &quot;Over oaking&quot; your spirit is a definite possibility. Every few weeks, a small sample should be drawn from the vessel to ascertain quality of aging. Once the whiskey has achieved the color and smoothness of your liking, transfer it to a glass bottle or jar for long term storage.","creation_tsz":1467325830,"ending_tsz":1477866630,"original_creation_tsz":1421186879,"last_modified_tsz":1467325830,"price":"5.24","currency_code":"USD","quantity":17,"tags":["Oak Sticks","Charred Oak","Oaking","Whiskey","Making moonshine","moonshine","Oak Barrels","Toasted Oak","White Oak","Whiskey Elements","whiskey stick","American White Oak","whiskey barrel"],"category_path":["Supplies"],"category_path_ids":[69150433],"materials":["Kiln Dried White Oak","Charred Virgin White Oak"],"shop_section_id":null,"featured_rank":2,"state_tsz":1466804762,"url":"https://www.etsy.com/listing/218386636/charred-white-oak-sticks-for-aging?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":1223,"num_favorers":5,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":1,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"true","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":"men","occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":562,"taxonomy_path":["Craft Supplies & Tools"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":710765055,"hex_code":"363135","red":54,"green":49,"blue":53,"hue":312,"saturation":9,"brightness":21,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1421186879,"listing_id":218386636,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https://img1.etsystatic.com/060/0/8914196/il_75x75.710765055_666p.jpg","url_170x135":"https://img1.etsystatic.com/060/0/8914196/il_170x135.710765055_666p.jpg","url_570xN":"https://img1.etsystatic.com/060/0/8914196/il_570xN.710765055_666p.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https://img1.etsystatic.com/060/0/8914196/il_fullxfull.710765055_666p.jpg","full_height":1132,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":710668882,"hex_code":"534A47","red":83,"green":74,"blue":71,"hue":15,"saturation":14,"brightness":32,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1421186879,"listing_id":218386636,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https://img0.etsystatic.com/054/0/8914196/il_75x75.710668882_hqxl.jpg","url_170x135":"https://img0.etsystatic.com/054/0/8914196/il_170x135.710668882_hqxl.jpg","url_570xN":"https://img0.etsystatic.com/054/0/8914196/il_570xN.710668882_hqxl.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https://img0.etsystatic.com/054/0/8914196/il_fullxfull.710668882_hqxl.jpg","full_height":1132,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":710668692,"hex_code":"353036","red":53,"green":48,"blue":54,"hue":290,"saturation":11,"brightness":21,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1421186879,"listing_id":218386636,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https://img0.etsystatic.com/055/0/8914196/il_75x75.710668692_2h65.jpg","url_170x135":"https://img0.etsystatic.com/055/0/8914196/il_170x135.710668692_2h65.jpg","url_570xN":"https://img0.etsystatic.com/055/0/8914196/il_570xN.710668692_2h65.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https://img0.etsystatic.com/055/0/8914196/il_fullxfull.710668692_2h65.jpg","full_height":1132,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":710789947,"hex_code":"363135","red":54,"green":49,"blue":53,"hue":312,"saturation":9,"brightness":21,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1421186879,"listing_id":218386636,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https://img1.etsystatic.com/058/0/8914196/il_75x75.710789947_6pis.jpg","url_170x135":"https://img1.etsystatic.com/058/0/8914196/il_170x135.710789947_6pis.jpg","url_570xN":"https://img1.etsystatic.com/058/0/8914196/il_570xN.710789947_6pis.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https://img1.etsystatic.com/058/0/8914196/il_fullxfull.710789947_6pis.jpg","full_height":1132,"full_width":1500}],"Shop":{"shop_id":8914196,"shop_name":"TheMurrayMerchant","user_id":41559144,"creation_tsz":1421088769,"title":"Corbett&#39;s","announcement":null,"currency_code":"USD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":"We observe the Sabbath.

My name is Amy, and my husband, Tyler and I are the owners and creators of Liquid Courage. We have been selling online since 2003. Recently, we decided to make the leap from selling items made by others to selling items that we make. We have been goofing around making all sorts of arts, crafts, scrapbooks, and clothing for many years and decided to combine my hobby with my online business experience. \r\n\r\nTyler has an Accounting degree from Tennessee Technological University, and I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in Marketing and an MBA in Accounting from TTU as well.  Upon graduating, we tried &quot;real, grown-up jobs&quot; - Tyler as a general manager at a greenhouse manufacturing company, and I as a staff accountant for a nationwide manufacturing company.  We spent a couple of years working for &quot;the man&quot;...at a desk eight hours a day...fifty weeks a year.\r\n\r\nWe finally decided to follow our dream of becoming entrepreneurs, pursue our passion, and determine our own future with hands on approach.
